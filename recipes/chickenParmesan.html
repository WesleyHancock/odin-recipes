        <p>Chicken parmigiana, or chicken parmesan, is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast<br>
        covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh Mozzarella cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps of the process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F or 230 degrees C</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic
                (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.<br>
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a
                thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with
                salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl,
                set aside.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts,
                evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs.
                Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into
                both sides.<br> Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat
                until it begins to shimmer.<br>Cook chicken in the hot oil
                until golden, about 2 minutes per side.
                The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish.<br> Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.<br>
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese,
                fresh basil, and provolone cheese.<br>Sprinkle remaining Parmesan
                over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly
                and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center,
                15 to 20 minutes.<br> An instant-read thermometer inserted
                into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
